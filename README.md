# Compare different quadrature rules for integration

There are two examples provided for calculating the weights and abscissas for gaussian quadrature rules, try:

```
make
./gqconstants
```

or

```
python gqconstants.py
```

You can also use the C++ example as a guide to build your own executable

There is no need to look at rules >~25 for Gaussian quadrature.  And you can also stop a ~ 1000 divisions for the trapezoidal and Simpson's rules.
